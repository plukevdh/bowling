Welcome to the bowling game!
============================

The goal of this exercise is to build a tool to score a game of
bowling. If you are unfamiliar with the rules of scoring ten pin
bowling, the wikipedia page is fairly descriptive:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenpin#Scoring

Once you get your head wrapped around scoring a game of bowling, you
will want to check out `test_bowling.rb` which has the tests that must
pass.

Good luck and happy hacking!
