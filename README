Welcome to the bowling game!

The goal of this exercise is to build a tool to score a game of bowling. If you are unfamiliar with the rules of scoring ten pin bowling, the wikipedia page is fairly descriptive:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenpin#Scoring


Once you get your head wrapped around scoring a game of bowling, you will want to check out bowling_spec.rb which contains the specifications your code will need to implement.

You will need rspec to run the specs, which can be installed via ruby gems:

gem install rspec.

To run the specs:

spec bowling_spec.rb

Good luck and happy hacking!
