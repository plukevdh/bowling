Welcome to the bowling game!

The goal of the bowling game is to build a tool to score a game of bowling. If you are unfamiliar with the rules of scoring ten pin bowling, the wikipedia page is fairly descriptive:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenpin#Scoring


Once you get your head wrapped around scoring a game of bowling, you will want to check out bowling_spec.rb which contains the specs/tests.

You will need rspec to run the spec, which can be installed via gems:

gem install rspec.

To run the specs:

spec bowling_spec.rb

Good luck!
